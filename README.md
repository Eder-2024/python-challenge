Python First Assignment
In this Challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of your company. You will be given a financial dataset called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".
The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following values:
*The total number of months included in the dataset
*The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
*The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
*The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
*The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
*The final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
Solution .
In the first piece of code the PyBank, I mainly used "For Loops" and If statements to resolve the task. Also I added some comments in the code which is going to help to understand better how the code works.

# PyPoll
In this Challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process.
You will be given a set of poll data called election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following values:
*The total number of votes cast
*A complete list of candidates who received votes
*The percentage of votes each candidate won
*The total number of votes each candidate won
*The winner of the election based on popular vote
*IN the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
Solution .
In the first piece of code the PyPoll, I mainly used "For Loops", If statements, Dictionaries and list to resolve the task. Also I added some comments in the code which is going to help to understand better how the code works. In addition I based my dictionary code on https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries_access.asp.
